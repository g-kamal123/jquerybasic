        India is my country; all Indians are my brothers and sisters. I love my
        country, and I am proud of its rich and varied heritage. I shall always
        strive to be worthy of it. I shall respect my parents, teachers and all
        elders and treat everyone with courtesy. To my country and my people, I
        pledge my devotion. In their well being and prosperity lies my
        happiness.
